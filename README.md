NoiseyApp
=========

NoiseyApp is a procedural texture generation application implemented in Java. Random noise generation is based on Perlin noise and fractal Brownian motion. The overall structure of the source code (i.e. modular design) is heavily inspired by the C++ libnoise library.

Several example routines have been slapped together, such as clouds, marble, electricity, and wood grain textures. Planned features include:
* Modular GUI, to graphically connect, configure and reorder noise sources.
* Colour gradient editor, to modify mapping between noise values and texture colour output.
* Animated noise

This project is meant primarily for experimentation and reaquainting myself with Java. However, the code is free for any to use, and I would greatly appreciate any feedback or contributions from anyone who is interested.
